# Brazilian municipalities population

This repo contains data on Brazilian municipalities population from IBGE (Census and Intercensus estimates). The data covers all 5.570 municipalities from 2000 to 2017. The original data can be downloaded [here](https://sidra.ibge.gov.br/home/pimpfbr/brasil).

The cleaned data in `.Rda` format can be download [here](https://github.com/meirelesff/munic_population/raw/master/pop_ibge_2000_2017.Rda). Conversely, one may get the data direct from `R`:
